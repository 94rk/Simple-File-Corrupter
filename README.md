# Simple File Corrupter (SFC)

SFC is a lightweight console utility written in C# that lets you corrupt files and change their size.

## Features

- Corrupt any file  
- Change a file's size  
- Runs directly in CMD  
- Automatic file size detection  

## How to Use

1. Run the tool  
2. Drag & drop or type a file path  
3. Choose an option:
